# Radius Controller

This is a demo application that simulates a controller to set room temperature using a radius with degrees and integer values.

### Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://fancy-radius.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

This application was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that provides everything needed to run and deploy the app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the radius controller to set the desired room temperature. Simply drag the controller to the desired degree and integer values.

This is a demo how to have a radius with degrees and integer values that simulates a controller to set room temperature.

It uses Next.js to bootstrap the application and to already provide everything needed to run the app and also to deploy it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
